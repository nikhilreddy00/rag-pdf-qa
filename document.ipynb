The team does a strong job framing the problem, identifying appropriate \\noutcome and treatment variables, and recognizing that a true randomized controlled trial (RCT) \\nis impossible in this context. The proposed approach-combining matching, pre/post comparisons, \\nand Difference-in-Differences (DiD) with panel data-is conceptually appropriate and \\nmethodologically sophisticated. \\nThe central tension in the current work is between the ambition of the research question \\n(“Which interventions work, where?”) and the limitations of the pilot implementation. The pilot \\ndata are used mainly to demonstrate matching and panel construction, but they are not yet \\nsufficient to convincingly estimate treatment effects or differentiate between types of \\ninterventions. Bridging this gap-between design and implementation-should be the team’s \\nhighest priority moving forward. \\nBelow is a detailed critique organized by the rubric items. \\n \\n1. Random Assignment of Subjects  \\nStrengths \\n• \\nThe team correctly recognizes that randomly assigning Vision Zero safety treatments \\nto intersections is not feasible. \\n• \\nEthical constraints are articulated: the city cannot withhold or delay safety interventions \\nat high-risk locations simply to preserve a “control” group. \\n• \\nPractical constraints are also implicit: DOT’s planning, political priorities, and budget \\ncycles drive where and when interventions occur, so the rollout is inherently non-random. \\nAreas for Improvement \\n• \\nThe discussion focuses mainly on “we can’t randomize” but could go one step further by \\nasking whether any partial or marginal randomization is possible: \\no For example, among equally high-priority locations, could timing be staggered \\nquasi-randomly? \\no Could less-proven intervention types be piloted in a way that approximates \\nrandom assignment?'),\n",

This sets up a clear transition from “no RCT” to “here’s our best \\nalternative.” \\n \\n2. Threats to Internal Validity  \\nStrengths \\n• \\nThe team identifies several key threats: \\no History: citywide policies (e.g., broader Vision Zero initiatives, speed camera \\nexpansion), COVID-19, economic conditions, construction projects, gas prices, \\netc. \\no Regression to the Mean: interventions are targeted at extreme high-crash \\nlocations that may naturally regress toward average even without treatment. \\no Experimental Mortality (Attrition of Locations): treated or control sites may \\neffectively “drop out” because of damaged infrastructure or missing crash data. \\no Instrumentation: changes in crash reporting systems or enforcement \\ntechnologies that could affect measured outcomes over time. \\n• \\nThe examples are concrete and specific to NYC, which makes the threat analysis realistic \\nand grounded. \\nCritical Omissions \\n• \\nSelection Bias (Site-Level): \\nInterventions are deliberately targeted to high-priority, high-crash intersections and \\nsegments, which likely differ from non-priority sites in many ways: \\no traffic volume, land use, nearby transit, demographic characteristics, etc. \\nWhile matching helps, the selection process itself is a major source of bias that \\ndeserves explicit discussion as a threat, not just a design detail. \\n• \\nTraffic Volume Confound: \\nMuch like the weather-severity example in the earlier critique, crash outcomes are \\nstrongly tied to exposure (how many people and vehicles move through a location). If \\ntraffic volume trends differ between treated and control intersections (e.g., due to transit \\nchanges or neighborhood development), estimates of treatment effects may capture these \\nvolume shifts rather than the impact of the intervention itself.'),\n",
