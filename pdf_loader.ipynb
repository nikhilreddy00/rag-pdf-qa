The team does a strong job framing the problem, identifying appropriate outcome and treatment variables, and recognizing that a true randomized controlled trial (RCT) is impossible in this context. The proposed approach-combining matching, pre/post comparisons, and Difference-in-Differences (DiD) with panel data-is conceptually appropriate and methodologically sophisticated. The central tension in the current work is between the ambition of the research question (“Which interventions work, where?”) and the limitations of the pilot implementation. The pilot data are used mainly to demonstrate matching and panel construction, but they are not yet sufficient to convincingly estimate treatment effects or differentiate between types of interventions. Bridging this gap-between design and implementation-should be the team’s highest priority moving forward. Below is a detailed critique organized by the rubric items.  1. Random Assignment of Subjects  Strengths • The team correctly recognizes that randomly assigning Vision Zero safety treatments to intersections is not feasible. • Ethical constraints are articulated: the city cannot withhold or delay safety interventions at high-risk locations simply to preserve a “control” group. • Practical constraints are also implicit: DOT’s planning, political priorities, and budget cycles drive where and when interventions occur, so the rollout is inherently non-random. Areas for Improvement • The discussion focuses mainly on “we can’t randomize” but could go one step further by asking whether any partial or marginal randomization is possible: o For example, among equally high-priority locations, could timing be staggered quasi-randomly? o Could less-proven intervention types be piloted in a way that approximates random assignment?'),\n",

Recommendation Explicitly state that while full randomization is infeasible for ethical and logistical reasons, the study will instead exploit as-if random variation in timing and location of treatments using quasi-experimental designs. This sets up a clear transition from “no RCT” to “here’s our best alternative.”  2. Threats to Internal Validity  Strengths • The team identifies several key threats: o History: citywide policies (e.g., broader Vision Zero initiatives, speed camera expansion), COVID-19, economic conditions, construction projects, gas prices, etc. o Regression to the Mean: interventions are targeted at extreme high-crash locations that may naturally regress toward average even without treatment. o Experimental Mortality (Attrition of Locations): treated or control sites may effectively “drop out” because of damaged infrastructure or missing crash data. o Instrumentation: changes in crash reporting systems or enforcement technologies that could affect measured outcomes over time. • The examples are concrete and specific to NYC, which makes the threat analysis realistic and grounded. Critical Omissions • Selection Bias (Site-Level): Interventions are deliberately targeted to high-priority, high-crash intersections and segments, which likely differ from non-priority sites in many ways: o traffic volume, land use, nearby transit, demographic characteristics, etc. While matching helps, the selection process itself is a major source of bias that deserves explicit discussion as a threat, not just a design detail. • Traffic Volume Confound: Much like the weather-severity example in the earlier critique, crash outcomes are strongly tied to exposure (how many people and vehicles move through a location). If traffic volume trends differ between treated and control intersections (e.g., due to transit changes or neighborhood development), estimates of treatment effects may capture these volume shifts rather than the impact of the intervention itself.'),\n",

If control sites are geographically close to treated sites, spillovers can bias effects toward zero or even flip their sign. • Seasonality and Long-Term Trends: While “history” is mentioned broadly, more explicit acknowledgment of seasonal crash cycles (e.g., winter vs summer, school year vs holidays) and secular trends in safety would clarify why multiple years of data and time fixed effects are needed. Recommendation Expand this section to explicitly name selection bias, traffic volume, and spillovers as major threats. These mechanisms are highly plausible in NYC and are central to interpreting any estimated effect of Vision Zero treatments.  3. Quasi-Experimental Designs to Mitigate Threats  Strengths • The project proposes a well-thought-out combination of quasi-experimental tools: o Pretest–Posttest Non-Equivalent Control Group: comparing crash outcomes before and after treatment for both treated and matched control locations. o Matching: selecting control intersections from the Priority Intersections pool based on baseline crash counts, geography, and street characteristics. o Difference-in-Differences (DiD): estimating treatment effects using changes over time for treated vs control sites. o Multiple Time-Series: leveraging multiple years of data to check pre-trends and avoid simplistic single pre/post snapshots. • This layered approach is appropriate for a complex, non-randomized city rollout and shows good understanding of modern causal inference practices. Areas for Improvement • Model Specification Clarity: The intended DiD model is described conceptually, but not fully specified. For example: o What is the time unit (year, quarter, month)? o Will the model include location and year fixed effects? o How will standard errors be handled (e.g., clustering at the intersection level)? • Treatment Heterogeneity: The motivating question is “Which Vision Zero interventions work?” but the design, as'),\n",

Different intervention types (turn calming, speed humps, etc.) may have different effects and timelines. • Exposure and Denominator Issues: The outcome is framed as “pedestrian injuries and deaths per location (rate),” but the denominator (exposure) is not fully discussed. Without adjusting for traffic and pedestrian volume, location-level “rates” may be misleading and compromise DiD assumptions. • Timing of Treatment: The project uses Treatment_completion as the treatment date, but it would help to clarify: o How many pre- and post-periods are planned? o How the team will handle partial years or staggered rollouts. Recommendations • Explicitly write out the core regression model, including: o outcome: pedestrian casualties at intersection i in time t o key regressor: treatedᵢ × postᵢt o controls: intersection fixed effects, time fixed effects (year or month), plus possibly time-varying covariates (e.g., borough-by-year trends). • Consider adding treatment-type indicators (or interaction terms) once the sample size allows, so the analysis can move beyond a simple treated/untreated contrast. • If feasible, incorporate some proxy for exposure (e.g., traffic counts or functional class/land-use controls) to better interpret results as effects on risk rather than raw counts.  4. Ruling Out or Measuring Remaining Threats  Strengths • The team proposes sensible strategies to mitigate threats: o History: Use Difference-in-Differences with time fixed effects so citywide shocks (e.g., COVID, broad policy changes) that affect both treated and control sites are differenced out. o Instrumentation: Apply location fixed effects and year fixed effects to absorb stable reporting quirks and citywide changes in measurement. o Experimental Mortality: Construct a balanced panel where possible and compare balanced vs full-sample results as a robustness check. o Regression to the Mean: Use multi-year pre-periods and match treated sites to other high-crash Priority Intersections so both groups are subject to similar regression dynamics. • Checking pre-trends visually for treated vs control groups is exactly what DiD requires and is clearly planned.'),\n",

This would provide much stronger evidence about both internal validity and timing of impact. • Quantifying Spillovers and Proximity Bias: The team acknowledges geographic matching but does not discuss how they will handle spillovers. Some options: o Exclude potential control sites within a specified buffer distance of treated sites, and compare results to the full sample. o Include a variable indicating proximity to treated intersections to see if “nearby but untreated” locations also experience changes. • Sensitivity Analyses for Selection and Volume: While matching helps address observable selection, unobserved differences remain: o The team could perform sensitivity analyses (e.g., varying matching calipers, including additional baseline covariates) and report how stable the treatment effect estimates are. o If any traffic count or transit ridership data are available, they could be used to test how robust results are to controlling for changes in volume. • Prioritizing Threats by Plausibility: Much like the earlier weather critique, it would help to distinguish between threats that are theoretically possible and those that are highly plausible in NYC during the study period. History and selection/volume seem much more central than, for example, rare instrumentation changes. Recommendations • Add event-study plots and robustness checks (different control sets, dropping near neighbors, balanced vs unbalanced panels) as explicit planned analyses. • When presenting final results, structure the discussion around: (1) baseline estimate, (2) estimates under different robustness checks, and (3) what range of plausible bias remains.  5. Demonstration on Pilot Data  Strengths • The pilot stage successfully demonstrates several key data engineering steps: o Spatially joining crash points to intersections (within a distance threshold). o Linking Vision Zero treatment data via geometry and treatment completion dates.'),\n",

Areas for Improvement • Lack of Actual Effect Estimates: The pilot focuses on describing matching and sample construction, but does not show: o A simple pre/post comparison of average pedestrian casualties for treated vs controls, or o A preliminary DiD regression (with big caveats about power). Even a noisy estimate would better demonstrate the full experimental logic. • Unbalanced Treated vs Control Intersections: The pilot ends with about 101 treated sites and a relatively small number of unique control intersections. This creates two issues: o Heavy reuse of the same control intersections across multiple treated units. o Potential inflation of precision if standard errors are not correctly clustered at the intersection level. • Pre-Trends Not Yet Assessed: Pilot slides describe the panel, but there is no visual or numerical check of whether treated and control intersections follow similar trends before treatment. • Clarity on Time Window: The choice of pre- and post-periods around the treatment completion date is not fully specified. Different windows (e.g., 1 vs 3 vs 5 years) could yield very different patterns, especially given broader Vision Zero policy changes. Recommendations • As part of the pilot, present at least: o One time-series graph (treated vs control average casualty rates over time, with vertical line at treatment). o One simple DiD estimate, clearly labeled as preliminary and underpowered. • Explore whether relaxing some matching constraints can increase the number of unique control intersections, or explicitly justify a design with fewer but better-matched controls. • Specify the exact pre/post windows used in pilot analyses (e.g., 3 years before and 3 years after treatment) so the design is replicable and interpretable.

Tighten the connection between the research question and the design. Clearly state how the proposed DiD model will eventually distinguish between types of interventions (not just treated vs untreated). 2. Elevate the internal validity discussion. Explicitly incorporate selection bias, traffic volume, and spillovers as central threats and map them to specific design choices and robustness checks. 3. Extend the pilot from “data plumbing” to “design demonstration.” Include at least one preliminary effect estimate and a pre-trends plot, even if the results are imprecise, to show the design in action. Analytical Next Steps • Finalize the DiD specification with fixed effects and clustered standard errors. • Conduct event-study analyses to test for parallel trends and dynamic effects. • Implement robustness checks (balanced panels, distance buffers, alternative control sets) to gauge the magnitude of remaining biases. If the team can successfully move from a strong conceptual design to a fully implemented, transparent analysis—with clear handling of selection, volume, and spillovers—this project has real potential to provide actionable evidence for NYC DOT and Vision Zero practitioners.

The proposed approach-combining matching, pre/post comparisons, and Difference-in-Differences (DiD) with panel data-is conceptually appropriate and methodologically sophisticated.

Bridging this gap-between design and implementation-should be the team’s highest priority moving forward. Below is a detailed critique organized by the rubric items.  1. Random Assignment of Subjects  Strengths • The team correctly recognizes that randomly assigning Vision Zero safety treatments to intersections is not feasible. • Ethical constraints are articulated: the city cannot withhold or delay safety interventions at high-risk locations simply to preserve a “control” group. • Practical constraints are also implicit: DOT’s planning, political priorities, and budget cycles drive where and when interventions occur, so the rollout is inherently non-random.

Areas for Improvement • The discussion focuses mainly on “we can’t randomize” but could go one step further by asking whether any partial or marginal randomization is possible: o For example, among equally high-priority locations, could timing be staggered quasi-randomly? o Could less-proven intervention types be piloted in a way that approximates random assignment?'),\n",

Recommendation Explicitly state that while full randomization is infeasible for ethical and logistical reasons, the study will instead exploit as-if random variation in timing and location of treatments using quasi-experimental designs. This sets up a clear transition from “no RCT” to “here’s our best alternative.”  2. Threats to Internal Validity  Strengths • The team identifies several key threats: o History: citywide policies (e.g., broader Vision Zero initiatives, speed camera expansion), COVID-19, economic conditions, construction projects, gas prices, etc. o Regression to the Mean: interventions are targeted at extreme high-crash locations that may naturally regress toward average even without treatment. o Experimental Mortality (Attrition of Locations): treated or control sites may'),\n",

Critical Omissions • Selection Bias (Site-Level): Interventions are deliberately targeted to high-priority, high-crash intersections and segments, which likely differ from non-priority sites in many ways: o traffic volume, land use, nearby transit, demographic characteristics, etc. While matching helps, the selection process itself is a major source of bias that deserves explicit discussion as a threat, not just a design detail. • Traffic Volume Confound: Much like the weather-severity'),\n",

If control sites are geographically close to treated sites, spillovers can bias effects toward zero or even flip their sign. • Seasonality and Long-Term Trends: While “history” is mentioned broadly, more explicit acknowledgment of seasonal crash cycles (e.g., winter vs summer, school year vs holidays) and secular trends in safety would clarify why multiple years of data and time fixed effects are needed. Recommendation Expand this section to explicitly name selection bias, traffic volume, and spillovers as major threats.

Without adjusting for traffic and pedestrian volume, location-level “rates” may be misleading and compromise DiD assumptions. • Timing of Treatment: The project uses Treatment_completion as the treatment date, but it would help to clarify: o How many pre- and post-periods are planned? o How the team will handle partial years or staggered rollouts.
